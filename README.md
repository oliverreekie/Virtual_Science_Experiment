# Virtual_Science_Experiment

This application acts as a platform, on which multiple experiments can be added to virtualise experiments for students to increase accessibility or add extra study opportunities.

This game is created in Unity and the document 'Final Dissertation Submission' contains great detail on the development process

This game includes the process of:

- Assembling the apparatus
- Rearranging equations
- Systematically conducting experiment
- Tabulating results
- Graphing and analysing the data
- Being graded on performance
